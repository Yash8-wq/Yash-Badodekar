# Automated Hydraulic Jack
I automated the operation of a traditional bottle jack by integrating a DC motor with a slotted crank mechanism, aiming to reduce manual effort and enhance operational efficiency. This project involved mechanical design, motor selection, and integration of the crank system to convert rotary motion into linear lifting motion. The automated solution significantly minimized the physical strain typically associated with manual jacking and demonstrated improved reliability and ease of use. This initiative highlighted the potential for low-cost automation in basic mechanical tools.
